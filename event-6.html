	<p style="color: black; margin-bottom: 10px;">In this session we will discuss using VR, AR, and stagecraft for experimental and observational research.  By creating a realistic (or realistic enough for your purposes) environment, you can create an experience that will elicit naturalistic behavior and afford adequate experimental validity:  even though participants are aware that the virtual environment isnâ€™t real, they still act as if it were a real situation.  We will discuss how to use this to good advantage and critical associated issues including research ethics and practical considerations.</p>
