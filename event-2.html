	<p style="color: black; ">Virtual Reality goes by many names and comes in many forms. We will try some of the best and worst examples of VR for ourselves and then take a broader look at mainstream VR hardware and software. The goal is to provide enough information for everyone to decide what VR is for themselves.</p>
